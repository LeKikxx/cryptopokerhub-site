  <h1>CoinPoker Review 2025: An Honest Player Perspective</h1>
  
  <p>After playing on CoinPoker for several months, here's my honest take as a regular player.</p>
  
  <h2>What I Liked</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>No KYC Required</strong> - Just email and crypto deposit. No documents, no selfie, no verification.</li>
    <li><strong>33% Flat Rakeback</strong> - Simple, weekly, automatic. No VIP tiers to figure out.</li>
    <li><strong>Fast Withdrawals</strong> - USDT withdrawals in about 3-4 hours. No waiting days.</li>
    <li><strong>PLO Games</strong> - Good PLO action, especially at lower stakes.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>What Could Be Better</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Smaller Traffic</strong> - Fewer players than PokerStars. Less table selection during off-peak hours.</li>
    <li><strong>Basic Software</strong> - Functional but not fancy. Gets the job done.</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h2>The Rakeback Math</h2>
  <table>
    <tr><th>Your Weekly Rake</th><th>You Get Back</th><th>Your Cost</th></tr>
    <tr><td>$500</td><td>$165</td><td>$335</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$1,000</td><td>$330</td><td>$670</td></tr>
    <tr><td>$2,000</td><td>$660</td><td>$1,340</td></tr>
  </table>
  
  <h2>Is It Worth It?</h2>
  <p>If you value privacy, simple rakeback, and faster withdrawals than traditional sites - yes.</p>
  <p>If you need massive traffic and 50+ tables at every stake - maybe not.</p>
  
  <p>For recreational players who want a simple, private poker experience with decent rakeback - CoinPoker works.</p>
