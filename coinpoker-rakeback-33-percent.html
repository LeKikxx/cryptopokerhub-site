  <title>CoinPoker Rakeback: How to Get 33% Back Every Week</title>
</head>
<body>
  <h1>CoinPoker Rakeback: Get 33% Back Every Week</h1>
  
  <p>One of the best deals in online poker. 33% of every dollar you pay in rake is returned to you. Every Monday. Automatically.</p>
  
  <h2>What is Rakeback?</h2>
  <p>Rake is the fee poker sites charge to host games. It's usually 5-10% of each pot.</p>
  <p>Rakeback is a percentage of that fee returned to you. Think of it as a loyalty reward.</p>
  
  <h2>How CoinPoker Rakeback Works</h2>
  
  <h3>The Simple Formula</h3>
  <p>Every Monday, CoinPoker calculates your total rake for the week and returns 33% directly to your account.</p>
  <ul>
    <li>No VIP tiers to unlock</li>
    <li>No minimum volume required</li>
    <li>No complicated points system</li>
    <li>No "games" you must complete</li>
  </ul>
  
  <h3>Real Numbers Example</h3>
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Weekly Rake Paid</th>
      <th>Rakeback Received</th>
      <th>Effective Cost</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$100</td>
      <td>$33</td>
      <td>$67</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$500</td>
      <td>$165</td>
      <td>$335</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>$1,000</td>
      <td>$330</td>
      <td>$670</td>

    <tr>
      <td>$5,000</td>
      <td>$1,650</td>
      <td>$3,350</td>
