    <h2 id="what-is">What is Crypto Poker?</h2>
    <p>
      Crypto poker is simply online poker where you use cryptocurrencies as payment. 
      Instead of depositing euros or dollars via bank transfer or credit card, you deposit Bitcoin, USDT, Ethereum, or other crypto assets.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://record.coinpokeraffiliates.com/_i1xZZBjYZ9TUOsjNOfgKeWNd7ZgqdRLk/1/" class="affiliate-link">CoinPoker</a> is one of the most popular crypto poker platforms. 
      It offers all the advantages of traditional online poker, with the additional benefits of crypto: anonymity, fast transactions, and lower fees.
    </p>

    <h2 id="why-play">Why Play Crypto Poker?</h2>
    <p>
      There are several reasons why more and more players are turning to crypto poker:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>No KYC:</strong> No mandatory identity verification. Your privacy is protected.</li>
      <li><strong>Fast withdrawals:</strong> No more waiting 5-10 days to receive your winnings. A few hours is all it takes.</li>
      <li><strong>Lower fees:</strong> Crypto transactions are generally cheaper than traditional transfers.</li>
      <li><strong>Premium rakeback:</strong> CoinPoker offers up to 33% rakeback, one of the best in the market.</li>
      <li><strong>Anonymity:</strong> Your transactions are pseudonymous, not linked to your bank identity.</li>
    </ul>

    </div>

    <h2 id="prepare">Prepare Your Crypto Wallet</h2>
    <p>
      Before playing, you need a crypto wallet to store and transfer your funds. There are several types of wallets:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Hot wallets:</strong> Software connected to the internet (Exodus, MetaMask). Convenient for frequent transactions.</li>
      <li><strong>Cold wallets:</strong> Physical devices (Ledger, Trezor). More secure for long-term storage.</li>
      <li><strong>Exchange wallets:</strong> Wallets provided by platforms like Binance or Coinbase. Convenient but less secure.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For playing crypto poker, a hot wallet or exchange wallet is more than enough. 
      Never deposit more than you're willing to lose.
    </p>

    <h2 id="signup">Signing Up on CoinPoker</h2>
    <p>
      Signing up on CoinPoker is simple and takes just a few minutes:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Go to the CoinPoker website</li>
      <li>Click "Sign Up"</li>
      <li>Enter your email address</li>
      <li>Create a secure password</li>
      <li>Accept the terms and conditions</li>
      <li>Validate your registration</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>No KYC required</strong> to sign up. Your account is activated immediately. 
      You can then deposit and play without having submitted any identity documents.
    </p>

    <h2 id="deposit">Depositing Your Crypto</h2>
    <p>
      Once your account is created, here's how to deposit:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Log in to your CoinPoker account</li>
      <li>Click "Deposit"</li>
      <li>Choose the crypto you want to use (BTC, ETH, USDT, CHP...)</li>
      <li>Copy the deposit address displayed</li>
      <li>Transfer your crypto from your wallet to this address</li>
      <li>Wait for confirmations (usually 1-3 for USDT, more for BTC)</li>
      <li>Your funds appear in your account</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      <strong>Tip:</strong> Use USDT for your deposits. It's a stablecoin, so its value doesn't fluctuate like Bitcoin. 
      You play with a fixed amount without worrying about volatility.
    </p>

      <h3>Welcome Bonus Awaits</h3>
      <p>Deposit $20 minimum and get 150% match up to $2,000.</p>
      <a href="https://record.coinpokeraffiliates.com/_i1xZZBjYZ9TUOsjNOfgKeWNd7ZgqdRLk/1/" class="btn btn-primary" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">Deposit & Play</a>
    </div>

    <h2 id="play">Start Playing</h2>
    <p>
      Once your funds are deposited, you can access the poker tables. CoinPoker offers:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Cash Games:</strong> Continuous play with fixed buy-ins. You can enter and leave at any time.</li>
      <li><strong>Tournaments:</strong> Competitions with fixed buy-ins and guaranteed prizepools. SNG or MTT format.</li>
      <li><strong>Variants:</strong> Texas Hold'em (most popular), Omaha, and other less common variants.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
      For beginners, I recommend starting with micro-stakes cash games (buy-in of $1-$5). 
      This allows you to learn without risking too much money.
    </p>

    <h2 id="withdraw">Withdrawing Your Winnings</h2>
    <p>
      This is often the most frustrating part on traditional poker sites. With CoinPoker, it's much simpler:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>Click "Withdraw"</li>
      <li>Choose your crypto (usually USDT)</li>
      <li>Enter your destination wallet address</li>
      <li>Specify the amount</li>
      <li>Validate the request</li>
      <li>Wait for approval (usually a few hours)</li>
      <li>Receive your crypto in your wallet</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      Withdrawals are generally processed in under 24 hours, often in just a few hours. 
      This is a huge advantage compared to traditional methods.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tips">Tips for Beginners</h2>
    <p>
      Here are some tips to get started on your crypto poker journey:
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Manage your bankroll:</strong> Never play with money you can't afford to lose. A poker bankroll is an entertainment budget, not an investment.</li>
      <li><strong>Start small:</strong> Micro-stakes are perfect for learning. Don't rush to high-stakes tables.</li>
      <li><strong>Learn the basics:</strong> Know the probabilities, positions, starting hands. Poker is a game of skill.</li>
      <li><strong>Take advantage of rakeback:</strong> CoinPoker offers 33% rakeback. It's a significant part of your potential earnings.</li>
      <li><strong>Play responsibly:</strong> Set time and money limits. Poker should remain entertainment.</li>
    </ul>
