      <a href="https://record.coinpokeraffiliates.com/_i1xZZBjYZ9TUOsjNOfgKeWNd7ZgqdRLk/1/" class="affiliate-link">CoinPoker</a> accepts multiple cryptocurrencies for deposits. The most popular options are:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>USDT</strong> - The recommended option for poker players. As a stablecoin, its value stays pegged to the dollar, eliminating volatility risk during your sessions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Bitcoin (BTC)</strong> - The original cryptocurrency. Good if you already hold BTC and want to use it directly.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ethereum (ETH)</strong> - Popular alternative with faster transaction times than Bitcoin during normal network conditions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>CHP</strong> - CoinPoker's native token. Holding CHP on your account unlocks the full 33% rakeback rate.

    <h2 id="before-depositing">Before You Deposit</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Create your CoinPoker account</strong> if you haven't already. Registration takes just an email and password - no ID verification required.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Have your crypto ready</strong> in a wallet you control. Whether it's MetaMask, Trust Wallet, or an exchange wallet like Binance, make sure you can send transactions.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Double-check the deposit address</strong> before sending anything. Crypto transactions are irreversible. One wrong character and your funds could be lost forever.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Consider transaction fees</strong> before depositing. Network fees vary based on blockchain congestion. Sometimes it's worth waiting for fees to drop.
    </p>

    <h2 id="step-by-step">Step-by-Step Deposit Process</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 1:</strong> Log in to your CoinPoker account and navigate to the Cashier or Deposit section.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 2:</strong> Select your preferred cryptocurrency from the list. USDT (TRC20 or ERC20) typically offers the best combination of low fees and fast confirmation.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 3:</strong> Copy the deposit address displayed. This is unique to your account for this specific transaction.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 4:</strong> Open your wallet or exchange and initiate a transfer to the address you copied. Paste carefully - don't type it manually.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 5:</strong> Wait for blockchain confirmations. USDT on TRC20 usually confirms in 1-2 minutes. BTC can take 10-60 minutes depending on network traffic.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Step 6:</strong> Your funds will appear in your CoinPoker account once confirmed. If there's a delay beyond expected time, contact support.

      <h3>33% Rakeback Available</h3>

    <h2 id="usdt-deposit">USDT Deposit (Recommended)</h2>
    <p>
      USDT is my recommended deposit method for poker players. Here's why:
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>No volatility risk</strong> - Your deposit stays worth the same whether you're winning or losing. No worrying about BTC crashing mid-session.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Low fees</strong> - USDT on TRC20 network costs pennies to transfer, even during busy periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Fast confirmation</strong> - TRC20 USDT confirms in about a minute on average.
    </p>
    <p>
      To deposit USDT, select TRC20 (Tron) network for lowest fees, or ERC20 if your wallet only supports Ethereum. The process is identical otherwise.
    </p>

    <h2 id="btc-deposit">BTC Deposit</h2>
    <p>
      Bitcoin deposits work the same way but require more confirmations for security. Expect 2-6 confirmations before your BTC appears in your account.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Network fees matter more with BTC</strong> - During congested periods, fees can spike to several dollars. Check a fee estimator before depositing small amounts.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wait time is longer</strong> - A single Bitcoin block takes about 10 minutes on average. With 2-6 required confirmations, budget 20-60 minutes for your deposit to clear.
    </p>
    <p>
      My recommendation: use USDT unless you specifically want to hold Bitcoin. The convenience and fee advantages are significant.
    </p>

    <h2 id="tips">Pro Tips for Deposits</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Test with a small amount first</strong> - Always send a test transaction before depositing your full bankroll. Verify the address works.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Time your deposits</strong> - Check blockchain congestion before depositing large amounts. Fees can vary 10x between busy and quiet periods.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Keep records</strong> - Screenshot your transaction IDs and deposit confirmations. The blockchain is transparent but your records help with accounting.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Buy CHP for rakeback</strong> - Deposit some USDT to play and some CHP to hold. The 33% rakeback pays for the CHP purchase quickly.
    </p>

    <h2 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting Common Issues</h2>
    <p>
      <strong>Deposit not showing up:</strong> Check blockchain explorers like Etherscan or Tronscan to verify the transaction was confirmed. If confirmed on blockchain, contact CoinPoker support with your transaction ID.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Wrong address used:</strong> If you sent BTC to an ETH address or vice versa, recovery is unlikely. Always double-check the network type before sending.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Minimum deposit not met:</strong> Each crypto has a minimum deposit amount. Deposits below minimum may be lost. Check the current minimums before sending.
